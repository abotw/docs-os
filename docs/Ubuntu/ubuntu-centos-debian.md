# Ubuntu vs CentOS vs Debian

*A Beginner’s Guide*

## 1. Why So Many Linux Distributions?

Linux is a **kernel**, not a full operating system.
Different communities and companies build **distributions (distros)** around it with different goals:

-   Stability
-   Ease of use
-   Enterprise support
-   Update speed

Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian are three of the most common.

## 2. Quick Overview Table

| Feature           | Ubuntu                | Debian                  | CentOS                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Base              | Debian                | Independent             | Red Hat Enterprise Linux |
| Target users      | Beginners, developers | Stability-focused users | Servers, enterprise      |
| Package manager   | `apt`                 | `apt`                   | `dnf` / `yum`            |
| Release style     | Time-based            | Stability-based         | Enterprise-style         |
| Default desktop   | GNOME                 | None / optional         | None                     |
| Ease of use       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐                 | ⭐⭐⭐                     | ⭐⭐                       |
| Server popularity | Very high             | High                    | Very high                |

## 3. Debian: The Foundation

### 3.1 What Is Debian?

**Debian** is one of the **oldest Linux distributions** and is famous for:

-   Rock-solid stability
-   Strong community governance
-   Very strict software policies

Many distros are built **on top of Debian**, including Ubuntu.

### 3.2 Debian Release Branches

| Branch   | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Stable   | Very reliable, older software |
| Testing  | Newer packages, less tested   |
| Unstable | Rolling, developers only      |

👉 Beginners usually use **Stable**.

### 3.3 Pros & Cons of Debian

**Pros**

-   Extremely stable
-   Minimal and clean
-   Long-term reliability

**Cons**

-   Software versions can be old
-   More manual setup
-   Less beginner-friendly UI

## 4. Ubuntu: Debian Made Friendly

### 4.1 What Is Ubuntu?

**Ubuntu** is based on **Debian**, but aims to be:

-   Easier to use
-   Faster to set up
-   More modern

It is maintained by **Canonical**.

### 4.2 Why Ubuntu Is Popular

-   Easy installer
-   Good hardware support
-   Frequent updates
-   Strong documentation

Ubuntu focuses on **usability + stability**.

### 4.3 Ubuntu LTS

Ubuntu’s **LTS (Long Term Support)** releases:

-   5 years of updates
-   Recommended for beginners and servers

Example:

-   Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### 4.4 Pros & Cons of Ubuntu

**Pros**

-   Beginner-friendly
-   Modern software
-   Huge community
-   Great cloud support

**Cons**

-   Slightly heavier than Debian
-   Snap packages are controversial

## 5. CentOS: Enterprise Linux Clone

### 5.1 What Is CentOS?

**CentOS** was traditionally a **free rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**.

It focuses on:

-   Enterprise stability
-   Long-term support
-   Server workloads

### 5.2 CentOS Stream (Important!)

CentOS has changed:

| Old           | New            |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| CentOS Linux  | ❌ discontinued |
| CentOS Stream | ✅ current      |

**CentOS Stream** sits:

```
Fedora → CentOS Stream → RHEL
```

It is **rolling-preview**, not a clone anymore.

### 5.3 Pros & Cons of CentOS

**Pros**

-   Enterprise-style environment
-   RHEL compatibility
-   Long lifecycle concepts

**Cons**

-   Not beginner-friendly
-   Older software
-   CentOS Stream may be confusing

## 6. Package Management Comparison

| Distro | Command             |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| Ubuntu | `apt install nginx` |
| Debian | `apt install nginx` |
| CentOS | `dnf install nginx` |

Key difference:

-   Debian/Ubuntu → `.deb`
-   CentOS/RHEL → `.rpm`

## 7. Configuration Style Differences

| Area         | Ubuntu / Debian          | CentOS              |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Network      | Netplan / NetworkManager | NetworkManager      |
| Firewall     | `ufw`                    | `firewalld`         |
| SELinux      | Disabled by default      | Enabled             |
| Config style | Simple                   | Enterprise-oriented |

## 8. Which One Should You Choose?

### 8.1 Choose Ubuntu If:

-   You are a beginner
-   You want desktop + server
-   You use cloud, Docker, WSL
-   You want fast setup

✅ **Best beginner choice**

### 8.2 Choose Debian If:

-   You want maximum stability
-   You prefer minimal systems
-   You are comfortable with Linux

### 8.3 Choose CentOS If:

-   You work with enterprise servers
-   You need RHEL-like environments
-   You are learning system administration

## 9. Simple Mental Model

```
Debian  →  Ubuntu  →  User-friendly Linux
RHEL    →  CentOS  →  Enterprise Linux
```

## 10. Beginner Recommendation

For most beginners:

1.  Start with **Ubuntu LTS**
2.  Learn basic Linux commands
3.  Try Debian later for stability
4.  Learn CentOS if you work with servers
